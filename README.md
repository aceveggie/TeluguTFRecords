# TeluguTFRecords
Program to read and write telugu TF RECORDS.


I scrapped some telugu character data off the web from http://www.pseudoaj.com/2016/05/pseudoajdataset0-telugu-handwritten.html

Then decided to write the MNIST data format of these files into native Google's TFRecord format. I got some help from http://warmspringwinds.github.io/tensorflow/tf-slim/2016/12/21/tfrecords-guide/

This is simple utility to read and write tfrecords (you can modify this for any data).
